# flight_data_analysis
This project focuses on data cleaning and feature engineering on a flight dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling. The objective was to transform raw flight data into structured, machine-learning-ready features using Python.
Tools Used
-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Google Colab
~Feature Engineering Performed
-Extracted journey day and month from date column
-Converted duration into total minutes
-Converted total stops into numerical format
-Handled missing values and cleaned inconsistent data entries
-Prepared dataset for future machine learning model training
Outcome
The dataset was successfully transformed into a clean and structured format suitable for machine learning model development. This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing and feature engineering.
